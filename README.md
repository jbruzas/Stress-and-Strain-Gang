## Phase 1

### System description and functional overview
Robotic arms have many uses in manufacuting and assembly. They are used for repetitive tasks like welding, sorting, or milling. These tasks are often done automatically. To be able to assist in or perform these tasks, the arm needs to pick up, maneuver, move, and hold items. For the purpose of this project, the robotic arm should be able to pick up and hold a 1 kilogram object, and will move via hydraulic power.

### Component breakdown with labeled figures/sketches
The robotic arm will have two main segments, the upper arm and forearm. Each segment will have a hydraulic attached to control the rotation of that arm.

### Kinematic description and basic calculations
There will be two arm segments that can rotate indepentantly, giving the arm two degrees of freedom in the position of the claw.

### Preliminary failure modes and design considerations
Failures are most likely to occur at the pin joints.
